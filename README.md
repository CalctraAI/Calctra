**Q: What types of hardware can I contribute?**  
A: Any computational resources including CPUs, GPUs, specialized AI accelerators, and storage capacity can be contributed to the network.

**Q: How am I compensated for providing resources?**  
A: Providers receive CAL tokens as payment for their computational resources, with rates determined by market demand and resource specifications.

**Q: How does Calctra ensure I'll get paid for my resources?**  
A: Smart contracts automatically handle payment escrow and distribution, ensuring providers are paid upon successful completion of computational tasks.

### For Researchers
**Q: How do I start using Calctra for my research?**  
A: Create an account, connect your wallet, deposit CAL tokens, and submit your computational job through our user-friendly interface.

**Q: Can I run any type of computation on Calctra?**  
A: Calctra supports a wide range of computational tasks through containerized environments, with certain restrictions for security and legal compliance.

**Q: How does Calctra protect my research data?**  
A: We implement end-to-end encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, and optional data anonymization to protect sensitive research data.

### Technical Questions
**Q: Why did Calctra choose Solana for its blockchain infrastructure?**  
A: Solana offers high throughput, low transaction costs, and fast finality, making it ideal for the micro-transactions required in a computational marketplace.

**Q: How does the resource matching algorithm work?**  
A: Our AI-driven algorithm matches computational requirements with available resources based on technical specifications, cost, geographical location, and historical performance.

**Q: What happens if a computation fails?**  
A: The platform implements automatic retries and fallback mechanisms. If computation ultimately fails due to provider issues, the user is not charged and the provider's reputation is adjusted accordingly.
